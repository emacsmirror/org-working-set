;; Purpose:
;;
;;  Maintain a small and changing subset of your org-nodes to visit with ease.
;;
;;  The working-set is a small set of nodes, among which you can switch
;;  rapidly; it is expected to change on a daily or even hourly basis.  Put
;;  nodes into your working set in order to return easily after any
;;  interruption.
;;  
;;  Please note, that org-working-set adds an id-property to all nodes in
;;  the working-set.
;;
;;  The list of ids from the nodes of your working-set is stored within the
;;  property-drawer of a distinguished node specified via
;;  `org-working-set-id'; this can be any node you choose and is itself not
;;  part of the working-set.
;;
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;  - org-working-set can be installed with package.el
;;  - Invoke `M-x org-customize', group 'Org Working-set', and
;;    set `org-working-set-id'.
;;

;;; Change Log:

;;   Version 1.0.0
;;
;;   - Moved functions for working set into its own file
;;   - Show breadcrumbs in working-set-menu
;;   - Prepare for melpa
;;
;;  See the package org-index for older news

  "Maintain a small and changing subset of your org-nodes to visit with ease.

The working-set is a small set of nodes, among which you can switch
rapidly; it is expected to change on a daily or even hourly basis.  Put
nodes into your working set in order to return easily after any
interruption.

Please note, that org-working-set adds an id-property to all nodes in
the working-set.

The list of ids from the nodes of your working-set is stored within the
property-drawer of a distinguished node specified via
`org-working-set-id'; this can be any node you choose and is itself not
part of the working-set.

This is version 1.0.0 of org-working-set.el.

The subcommands allow to:
- Modify the list of nodes (e.g. add new nodes)
- Circle quickly through the nodes
- Show a menu buffer with all nodes currently in the working set

Optional argument SILENT does not issue final message."
