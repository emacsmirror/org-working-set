** About this Package

*** Purpose

    Maintain a small and changing subset of your org-nodes to visit with ease.
    
    The working-set is a small set of nodes, among which you can switch
    rapidly; it is expected to change on a daily or even hourly basis.  Put
    nodes into your working set in order to return easily after any
    interruption.
    
    Please note, that org-working-set adds an id-property to all nodes in
    the working-set.
    
    The list of ids from the nodes of your working-set is stored within the
    property-drawer of a distinguished node specified via
    `org-working-set-id'; this can be any node you choose and is itself not
    part of the working-set.

*** Setup

    - org-working-set can be installed with package.el
    - Invoke `M-x org-customize', group 'Org Working-set', and
      set `org-working-set-id'.

** Screenshot

   Normally you won't see much of this package, but if requested it shows s menu of 
   all nodes within the working set (lower window).
