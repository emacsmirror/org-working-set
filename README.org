** About this Package

*** Purpose

    Maintain a small and volatile subset of your org-nodes to visit with ease.
    
    The working-set is a small number of nodes, among which you can
    switch rapidly; it is expected to change on a daily or even hourly
    basis.  E.g. if during a day you work on three projects in short
    intervals and have two meetings, you might add those five nodes to
    your working set one after another and switch between them as
    needed.
    
    Please note, that org-working-set uses org-id throughout and
    therefore adds an id-property to all nodes in the working-set.

*** Setup

    - org-working-set can be installed with package.el
    - Invoke `org-working-set'; on first run it will ask for a
      node, where it may save the working-set.
    
    - Optionally invoke `M-x org-customize', group 'Org Working-set',
      to tune its settings.
